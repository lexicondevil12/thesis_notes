#### Across the Divide: Reconciling Scrum and Enterprise with genre ecologies
##### Ben Johnson

- p.1: Abstract
    - TCs often working as 'full' members of agile dev teams, therefore uniquely able tp make sense of new communication challenges that arise in these contexts.
    - applies theoretical frameworks such as genre ecologies
    - _keep in mind that I want to argue against a foundational theory - does this preclude frameworks? What exactly do we mean by framework? Is framework = to ontology?_
- p.2: Intro
    > In doing so I theorize Scrum as a network of genres with observable mediational relationships. In analyzing these relationships, I provide recommendations for improving planning processes based on the emergent communication patterns observed over the period of study.

- agile = set of principles for software dev that revolve around change and empiricism.
    - _Wittgensteinian empiricism??_
- p.3
    - contrast with waterfall methods - waterfall breaks development into extended stages
        - software is completely designed, then developed, then tested.
    - in agile, these activities happen concurrently and repeatedly.
    - focus on 'empiricism' of real world testing feedback, whereas waterfall only tests at the end.
    - good definition of Scrum:
    > ...a process framework centered around small, self-organizing teams. Based on the iterative and continuous delivery of working software, Scrum teams work in two-week development "sprints." Team members commit to tasks they can accomplish within a sprint and demonstrate the resulting product directly to the client at the close of each sprint. The client provides feedback during and after the demonstration, which is then digested by the team and incorporated into the next iteration of the product, from design to documentation. This cyclical approach results in ongoing consensus between the development team and client as development moves forwardâ€”in the broadest sense, this is the product life-cycle in an agile mode.
    - the scrum process is a collectioin of highly-articulated rituals and documentation.
        - IOW, PM in any instance is a language game, and a collection of practices.
    - Importantly notes the lack of sequentially dependent steps.
- p.6
    - SCrum is flexible and not one size fits all
    - Organizations may adopt some parts of scrum and not others as it fits their organizational needs
    - Agile methods may be seen as existing on a continuum.
- p.7
    - scrum as genres...or perhaps more to the point, systems of genres
        - _what is the relationship between genres and practices?_
- p.8
> What genres of Scrum did the teams use to accomodate the planning and impact analysis needed for working with a complex, enterprise-level IT landscape?
> What changes to existing genres, or potential new genres might further improve...?

- So my version of these questions are:
1. What practices are evinced in traditional and agile PM methoologies?
2. What are the understandings of language and communication underlying both traditional and agile methodologies?
3. How might a Wittgensteinian understanding of language and communication help tradtional and agile methodologies?
