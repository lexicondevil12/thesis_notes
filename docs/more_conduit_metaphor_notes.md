#### Conduit metaphor notes

p. 287
> If there are dead metaphors in (1) through (3), then, they all seem
to involve the figurative assertion that language transfers human
thoughts and feelings. Notice that this assertion, even in its present,
very general form, leads already to a distinct viewpoint on communications
problems. A person who speaks poorly does not know how to use
language to send people his thoughts; and, conversely, a good speaker
knows how to transfer his thoughts perfectly via language. If we were
to follow this viewpoint, the next question would be: What must the
poor speaker do with his thoughts if he is to transfer them more accurately
by means of language? The surprising thing is that, whether we
like it or not, the English language does follow this veiwpoint. It provides,
in the form of a wealth of metaphorical expressions, answers to
this and other questions, all of which answers are perfectly coherent
with the assumption that human communication achieves the physical
transfer of thoughts and feelings. If there were only a few such expressions
involved, or if they were random, incoherent figures of speech
arising from different paradigms - or if they were abstract, not particularly
graphic images - then one might just succeed in dismissing
them as harmless analogies. But in fact, none of these mitigating circumstances
comes into play.

 - Conduit metaphors always have to do with inserting thoughts, feelings, ideas, mental activity into words; that there is an "inside" and an "outside" to a word.

 - P.289
	- "Repertoire" = Baggage - all your mental and emotional stuff that you bring to a given situation and probably some other stuff too (i.e. I think it might be best to understand "repertoire" as similar to Habitus).
		- what other things?
			- Genre (ecologies)
			- Practices
			- Whatever Gidden's was on about
			- At some point going to have to think about what W would have to say about Reddy.
	- RM = repertoire member - a term or expression that can be understood as referring to mental and emotional stuff...IOW, refering to or evincing some trait recognizable as originating from the speaker's mind. A _feeling or thought_ that one is attempting to "insert" into a word or sentence.

 - p.290
	 - _s_ = signal or vessel
		 - so, "physically put _RM_ (thoughts, feelings) into _s_ (word/phrase/sentence/poem)
	- **Major Framework** = core expressions that:
		- language is a conduit for transferring thoughts between people
		- people insert thoughts and feelings into words
		- words are able to transfer thoughts and feelings because they (words) can "contain" thoughts and feelings.
		- People are able to received and extract the sender's thoughts and feelings and derive meaning.

 - p.291 **Minor framework** - generally speaking, does not require the "container" aspect
	 - Thoughts and feelings are sent out into the "idea space"
	 - "Thoguhts and feelings are **_reified_** in this space (apparently means that once written or uttered, thoughts and feelings exist independently of the human mind - they are "out there" or "external."
	 - Reified thoughts and feelings sometimes find their way back into the minds of other humans

 - p.292 - 295  **Toolmaker's paradigm**
 - 295
 >Both models offer an explanation of the phenomenon of communication. But they come to totally different conclusions about what, in that phenomenon, are more natural states of affairs, and what are less natural, or constrained, states. In terms of the conduit metaphor, what requires explanation is failure to communicate. Success appears to be automatic. But if we think in terms of the toolmaker's paradigm, our expectation is precisely the opposite. Partial miscommunication, or divergence of readings from a single text are not aberrations. They are tendencies inherent in the systems, which can only be counteracted by continuous effort and by larges amounts of verbal interaction.

 - p.296
> - But I do not want to argue too strongly either for or against either of these models in this paper.
> - To me, from my vantage point now, it seems that the toolmakers paradigm and radical subjectivity simply for a coherent, common-sense view of what happens when we talk.
> - ...the conduit metaphor is a real and powerful semantic structure in English, which can influence our thinking - then if follows that "common-sense" about language may be confused.

 - p. 297: **Semantic Pathology**
 > - The logic of the framework [the conduit metaphor] runs like threads in many directions through the syntactic and semantic fabric of our speech habits. Merely becoming cognizant of this in no way alters the situation. Nor does it appear that one can adopt a new framework and develop it while ignoring the cloth of the language. For everywhere one runs into the old thread, and each one pushes conversation and thought back a little way toward the established pattern.

 - We commonly misuderstand the Whorf hypothesis
 - it doesn't mean that we can't ever think in terms of another model, but those moments will be fragmented and isolated.

 - p.298
	 - Characteristics of (core) expressions that eschew "conduit" language
		 - 1. Expressions are multisyllabic, abstract and therefore neither "graphic" (helpful for "showing" not "telling"??) nor metaphorically coherent. IOW, they're boring, $10 dictionary words. they do not propose an alternative to "putting thoughts and feelings into words" which remains the only available explanation.
			 - ex. communicate, disseminate
		 - \2. Can be used in conjunction with "in words" - words that imply that words have an "inside" and are capable of containing ideas.

 - p.299
	 >  A "Semantic Pathology" - arises "whenever two or more incompatible senses capable of figuring meaningfully in the same context develop around the same name." (_Principles of Semantics_, Stephen Ullmann)

- Example of the difficultly in avoiding the conduit metaphor:
	- Distinction between sympathy and apology - "I'm sorry" can mean "I empathize with your suffering," or "I admit fault and aplogize."
	- The issue becomes terms that could be RMs (term indiciating a thought or feeling or idea) or _s_'s (signals - the the thing which "contains" the idea or feeling - often referring to a word or text).
