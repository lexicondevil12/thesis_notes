- If I'm looking for evidence/occurence/prevalence of transmission based views of communication in PM literature, and assuming I find it, then it seems my argument becomes something like:
> This view is pervasive and shapes the way we think about and manage communication in PM situations.

- If so, then I'm arging that language  shapes our perception (which is the linguistic determinism/Whorf hypothesis if I'm not mistaken.
- But this seems contrary to Wittgenstein - who argued that the mental component of communication doesn't enter into our analysis of communication
- So what does W think of the Whorf hypothesis/determinism...
    - And is this a problem and how to I get around it? 
- As far as a resource for explaining the transmission theory, it seems Reddy is more than enough.
    - Lots of people seem to conflate all of these things: transmission theory, Cartesian(ism), Shannon-Weaver model - Is it       actually fair to use these interchangeably?
    - What about representation? Representation seems hairier so to speak
        - Rorty??    
    - Other things:
        - Latour - Reassembling the Social
            - Latour's idea that we're obligated to treat the subject of our study's motivation with due  "ontological                     weight" and not try to explain it away with "social stuff" seems important and relevant here.
