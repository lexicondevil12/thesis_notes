#### 4/17/17 Questions and notes

 - what does the wittgensteinian "empirical"/"ethnography entail?

 - genre, habitus, practices all seem to be able to be explained as roughly equivalent, so
 - Why is Wittgenstein better or what does he bring to the table that Bourdieu, Giddens, Miller, etc don't?
	 - Does W's "anti-theory" approach factoring in here? How is it helpful?
 - Does it make sense to even mention habitus, whatever Gidden's thing was, and genre? What does that accomplish?
 - Does my audience care about such distinctions?

 - more mind mapping
 - finish Reddy and start pulling examples from PM
	 - Why? To map the extent to which transmission/representational views inform PM doctrine.
 - **Other sources**: How "we" talk about "doing PM" work and what it says about our views on communication.
