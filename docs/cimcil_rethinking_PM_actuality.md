    - **Part 3. Conceptual/theoretical considerations**
        - 'project actuality' refers to the lived experience of practitioners (project managers, team members, etc.) whose actions, choices, and behaviors are embedded in, shaped, and re-shaped by power relationships, interactions between individuals and groups, and communication practices.
        - "project management is _social conduct_, defined by history, context, individual values and wider structural frameworks."
            - It is important to note that these structural frameworks can act as constraints, but are also generative and malleable and subject to change.
        - research into the actuality of projects involves examining _social processess_ and "how practitioners _think in action_."
        - cross-reference this with Ehn's statements about the cook that _reflects-in-action_ (pp.56) - unlike the Cartesian model, we aren't making detached observations and _then_ acting on them, the activities of rational observation and action are inseparable in the process of _doing_.
        - Shift in theoretical focus from top-down, linear, model-based, **pre-planned** - IOW Cartesian - to a practice-based, constructivist framework.
            - **Should I get into the power relations here? i.e. - how Cartesian model implies a "we know what's best for you" approach whereas the practice-based framework is more condusive to the "build with, not for" apprach?
            - Might be a good point to make somewhere - that the practice-based approach is more "respectful" to community members/users and  if users perceive PMs, civic technologists as respectful and open to their input, the resulting product might be better received? **Could even argue the the increased mutual respect is one of the desired _outcomes_.**
                - Then also would want to decide how to measure this.
        - "The former (traditional model) produces universal theory which, while sound, is not always useful in the specific context of application. The latter (practice-based) focuses on the empirical reality of projects by taking into account"
        - "Taking this research direction, scholars and practitioners ‘may inspire the construction of theories which include the moral dimension of human conduct in organisations and explain the dynamics of complex processes over time’"  [Calori R. Essai: real-time/real-space research: connecting action and reflection in organization studies. Org Stud 2002;23(6):877–83.]
        - _See bullet list outlined in red_
            - "the experience of emotions and feelings that drive action in complex environments."

    - bulleted list:
        - "...conscious effort to understand the interrelationship and inseparability between agency (individual behaviours and action) and structure (organisational policies, procedures, and legitimised routines) in the context, rather than considering them as discrete and detached from each other."
        - the value enbedded in this approach to research also applies to the practice - that is, knowledge and meaning co-produced by PMs, technologists and users.
