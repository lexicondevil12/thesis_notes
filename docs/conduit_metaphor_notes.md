#### Conduit Metaphor Notes
##### Michael Reddy

- p.487
> If there are dead metaphors in 1-3, then they all seem to involve the figurative assertion that language _transfers_ human thoughts and feelings.

- p.288
    - example 8 - Don't _force_ your _meanings into_ the wrong _words_.
    - suggests that meanings are _put_ into words and even more to the point, that we could put the meaning into the wrong word and this would somehow distort meaning.
    - there can be no _inside or outside_ of words.
    - many everyday expressions indicate that we (English speakers) view words as capable of containing (or failing to contain) thoughts - successful transmission lies with the speaker's skill at inserting meaning into the right words to properly convey it.
- p. 290
    - "the conduit metaphor and the core expressions that embody it"
        - conduit metaphor expressions are practices and self-perpepetuating
- 4 categories: major framework
1. language functions like a condui, transfers throughts bodily from person to person
2. people insert thoughts or feelings into words
3. words contain thoughts and feelings and convey them from person to person.
4. the receiver of the words has to extract or unpack meaning from words.

    - the major framework sees ideas as exisiting in human minds or in words
- the "minor framework"
1. thoughts and ideas and feelings are ejected by speaking or writing into an "external idea space."
2. thoughts and feelings are reified in the external space, so they exist independently of any need for humans to think or feel them
3. reified thoughts and feelings may or may not find their way back into the mind of a human

- p.296
    - toolmakers paradigm and radical subjectivity are actual common-sense and the dominance of the conduit metaphor indicates that common sense is 'confused'
    - What we take to be common-sense about language is confused
        - _this is essentially the point W makes._
- p.297
    - Can the conduit metaphor really affect our thinking, if we're able to so easily see around it just by thinking about it a bit? How does it do this?
    - just being aware of the conduit metaphor doesn't cancel out its effects-rejecting a systems as entrenched as the conduit metaphor will be more difficult
- p. 298
> 'Communication your feelings _using_ simpler words' for example, succeeds in avoiding the conduit metaphor while 'Communicate your feelings _i_n simpler terms' does not.

- p.290 - Semantic pathology
> A semantic pathology arises "whenever two or more incompatible senses capable of figuring meaningfully in the same context develop around the same name."
> for example, 'I'm sorry' can mean 'I empathize with your suffering' or 'I admit fauult and apologize.'
