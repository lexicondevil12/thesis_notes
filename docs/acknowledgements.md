Laura - There really are no words except I love you and thank you for putting up with me.
Mom and Dad - It goes without saying, but I couldn't have done this without your neverending support.
Evan and Koryn - Exemplary performance of siblingly duties including but not limited to: goofing off, stupid inside jokes, tech support, and project ideas.
Sarandos, Pete, and Val - True friends. Always willing to indulge (or at least listen to) my crazy ideas, even against your better judgment.
Pete, this whole graduate school debacle is actually kind of your fault :).
Adam Carr, Geoff Gimse, Farzad Diba
Professor Rachel Spilka - For bringing me in, the endless support,, being a credit to the profession of teaching, and convincing me not to quit.
Professor Anne Wysocki - I wish I could have taken more of your classes.
Professor Sandra Katchadorian - For chatting and understanding.
Professor David Clark - Fellow nerd, confidant, and metalhead in arms.
Dr. Bill - A whole hell of a lot, most of which I haven't finished processing yet.
Professor Patrick T. Riley (1941 - 2015) - For igniting my interest in philosophy, for teaching me how to think rather than what to think, and for a thoroughly entertaining and rousing final-lecture-before-retirement mic drop. That was one for the ages.
Ms. Joan Resch, Mr. Bob Kroncke, Mr. Mark Guardalebene, and Mr. Jerome Hajewski.
And probably a lot of others I've failed to mention by name, for which I apologize.
