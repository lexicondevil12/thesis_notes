#### List of Practices

> Review the multiplicity of language-games in the following examples, and in others:
 - Giving orders, and obeying them
 - Describing the appearance of an object, or giving its measurements
 - Constructiong an object from a description (a drawing)
 - Reporting about an event
 - Speculating about an event
 - Forming and testing a hypothesis
 - Presenting the results of an experiment in tables and diagrams
 - Making up a story; and reading it
 - Play-acting
 - Singing catches
 - Guessing riddles
 - Making a joke; telling it
 - Solving a problem in practical arithmetic
 - Translating from one language to another
 - Asking, thanking, cursing, greeting, praying

 > It is interesting to compare the multiplicity of the tools in language and of the ways they are used, the multiplicity of kinds of word and sentence, with what logicians have said about the structure of language. (Including the author of the _Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus_.)(ss.23)


> In particular, Wittgenstein challenges the idea that meaning resides in mental accompaniments to speech; he doesn't deny that we have such thoughts and feeling, or that we may "try" mentally to intend meaning, just that these things don't make any diffference to communication, because they don't enter into it. Paradigmatically, he take the case of pain. I know what "pain" means when I say, "I have a pain in my shoulder," but does my experience enter into the communication of saying that?

>> Now someone tells me that _he_ knows what pain is only from his own case! --Suppose everyone had a box with something in it: we'll call it a "beetle." No one can look into any else's box, and everyone knows what a beetle is only by looking at _his_ beetle. --Here it would be quite possible for everyone to have something different in his box. One might even imagine such a thing constantly changing. --But suppose the word "beetle" had a use in these people's language? --If so, it would not be used as the name of a thing. The thing in the box might even be empty. --No one can "divide through" by the thing in the box; it cancels out, whatever it is. (ss.293)

> In this way, Wittgenstein advocates a kind of linguistic behaviorism, in which the talk of internal states or entities (pain, belief, intention, willing, and so on) can make sense (because it is part of a language game) without having to believe such language gets its meaning from internal states or entities. Once we "divide through" and cancel out the internal entities, we lose the tempatation to think there is a (mental, psychological) thing that gets transmitted to another person. In a sense, this is the complete version of what Richard Rorty called the "linguistic turn," putting language at the center of  understanding communication and culture, making it fully constitutive.

>> It is sometimes said that animals do not talk because they lack the mental capacity. And this means: "they do not think, and that is why they do not talk." But--they simply do not talk. Or to put it better: they do not use language--if we except the most primitive forms of language. --Commanding, questioning, recounting, chatting, are as much a part of our natural history as walking, eating, drinking, playing. (ss.25)

> ..."meanings are in people," meanings are, so to speak, between people, in systems of meaningful linguistic and nonlinguistic behavior. Understanding another culture (or co-culture) doesn't mean we have to get into their heads, but only understand how they communicate, how they use language.
> - Keith, 489-90

#### Back to the Rough Ground
Keith-p.490-91
> Without transmission theory, and in view of the diversity of language, **a Wittgensteinian approach would require studying (in the sense of ethnography rather than phonetics) how people speak.** Once Wittgenstein has established his Kantian project for the conditions of possibility (the _Sprachspiel_ and the _Lebensform_), the remainder of the project is, in effect, empirical. **Theory remains the great tempation we must avoid; for philosophers the temptation was to reduce language to its logical essence**:

>> The more narrowly we examine actual language, the sharper becomes the conflict between it and our own requirement. (For the crystalline purity of logic was, of course, not a _result of investigation_, it was a requirement.). The conflict becomes intolerable; the requirement is now in danger of becoming empty. --We have got on to slippery ce where there is no friction and so in a certain sense the conditions are ideal, but also, just because of that, we are unable to walk. We want to walk: so we need _friction_. Back to the rough ground! (ss.107)

> Once a theory has become a lens through we can see only part of the important evidence and examples, even armchair philosophizing goes astray. In a sense, Wittgenstein criticized the ordinary problem of selectively assembling evidence to fit a theory. More deeply, however, he was making a point about what it could mean to think critically about language, or maybe anything else.
