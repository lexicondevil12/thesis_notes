### Initial Outline

##### Sections (not necessarily in any particular order)
1. Two views of communication
    1. Representation/Transmission
        -  Explain referencing Ehn, Keith, Reddy
    2. 'Anti-representation'
        - Wittgenstein, Rorty (maybe...I don't claim to have a great understanding of Rorty), Keith, Pleasants, Schatzki
        - **Where is it appropriate to go in depth into Wittgenstein's understanding of language and communication? After describing both kinds of PM?**
        - Practice theory?
2. Traditional PM (a/k/a 'linear', 'waterfall', 'cascade')
    1. Description of practices in 'linear' PM models
        - 'Top down' - Entire project planned in advance; attempts to anticipate difficulties.
        - Rigid, not flexible/dynamic.
            - Rigidity makes adaption to change difficult
        - What artifacts are produced?
            - charts, project plan, charter, project definition document (Horine book, also look up materials from Eng 710)
    2. What assumptions about language and communication are found in traditional PM practices and the artifacts produced thereof?
        - E.g. - What does a gant chart evince in terms of language and communication?
    3. What rhetorical practices are evident in 'linear' PM practices?
        - And how do these rhetorical practices relate to understandings of language and communication?
3. Emerging forms of PM
    1. Description of Agile, Scrum, etc. methodologies & practices
        - I'll use the term 'iterative' when referring to this 'family' of methodologies.
        - 'Iterative' approaches are dynamic/fluid
    2. What assumptions about language and communication are evident in 'iterative' practices and methodologies?
    3. What artifacts are produced and what do can they tell us about how 'iterative' methods view communication?
    4. What rhetorical practices are evident in 'iterative' approaches?
        - How do rhetorical practices in 'iterative' PM situations relate to understandings of language and communication?
4. Other things I want to bring in, address, or not sure where they belong
    1. Wittgenstein's anti-theorectical/philosophical critique; philosophy-as-therapy approach and what can it tell use about tech comm (TC) and PM. **_This aspect fascinates me and I'd really like to find a way to incorporate this into the paper._**
        - Why and how is this valuable to TC and PM?
    2. What is the structure of the analysis portion of the paper?
    3. From our discussion on 4.4.17:
        - What does 'content-based practices' (in traditional PM) vs. practices for process (in 'iterative' PM) refer to or mean? Didn't really understand this...
    4. Kairos, genre theory, and other stuff from TC and rhetorical theory
