#### Wittgenstein and Critical Theory - Introduction

- **II: Wittgenstein Against Theory**
- p.2
    - We treat W in one of 2 ways:
        - as a radically new method for giving accurate descriptions of certain phenomena
        - 'we may not advance any kind of theory. There must not be anything hypothetical in our considerations. We must do away with all _explanation_.'
    - Mutually exclusive: we can't say that we should avoid explanatory theories and claim to provide more accurate descriptions of phenomena.
        - Because of this, most people ignore the 'anti-theoretical' part of W's thought, and furthermore try to extract philosophical theories and 'ontological' insight.
        - The 'anti-theoretical' strain is ignored as unscientific.
    - W claims no special insight into social and political reality.
        _- Again, what is the value of this approach for TC and PM?_
- p.3
    - W is concerned with a very particular kind of theorizing activity: providing 'pictures' of phenomena. _How is this different that providing explanations?_
        - 'a particular picture of the essence of human language.'
    > "A philosophical picture, in Wittgenstein's sense, is a theoretical representation which has **lost its representational status** and has been reified into a peculiarly compelling portrayal of the **essence of some phenomena**. Such pictures are really only **metaphors, analogies, and representations**, but they are **experienced as knowledge of the essence of reality-in-itelf**: 'we predicate of the thing what lies in the method of representing it' (_ibid_ ss.104 _PI_). The compulsion is psychological as well as intellectual. When transfixed by a philosophical picture of some phenomena-such as, for example, the nature of 'mind', 'consciousness', 'self', and 'language', et. - we feel as thoughwe can see _directly_ (not just 'theoretically') how these things _must_ be, inherently, in and of themselves."
    - these picutres that W mentions are really better described as states of affairs.
- p.4
    - W's critique is directed at these metonymical and metaphorical explanations.
        - _How do representational, metaphorical, metonymmical theories manifest in TC and what are the effects?_
    - ex. the brain metonymically represents non-physical phenomena such as 'mind' and 'consciousness'.
    - Yet, ordinary language is frequently metaphorical, etc. and W doesn't say that there is anything wrong with this since we do not purport to strive for some perfect, transcendent, perfect form of language.
    - Philosophers, on the other hand, end up deluded into thinking exactly that: that various theories and forms of thought do offer something essential, transcendent, and in some cases, scientific.
- p.5
    - **W can be seen as engaging in a certain kind of 'ideology-critique'**
        - **This is possibly very important - W's thought can be used to critique the idea of the possibility of theory itself. Maybe this is the value - TC's can use it to critique other pervasive or entrenched schools of thought within TC and PM.**
    > This therapeutic method is called for because of the peculiar 'depth' (Wittgenstein 1968:ss.111) of entrenchment and compelling force of so many of the dominant pictures in philosophical discourse.
    - **As such, I can use W's ideas to critique TC but not to suggest that whatever I come up with is a superior theoretical understanding.**
    - **So for my proposal, I can argue that looking at TC and PM from a Wittgensteinian perspective is valuable because:**
        - **It is another tool or set of tools for critiquing dogma, status quo, and entrenched ideas in TC.**
        - **W's understanding of language and communication can be helpful for rethinking and perhaps even improving communnication in small development teams, and perhaps even moreso in the realm of civil tech projects, where the goal is to 'build _with_ rather than _for_'. Also help TC's and other tech workers communicate in a more effective and respectful way to the communities and individuals they collaborate with.**

**III: Critical Social Theory:  the new consensus**
- p.5
    - Critical Social Theory (CST) is concerned with identifying 'theorectical representations' of 'structures, rules, mechanisms, and power' that shape the social, individual agency, etc.
    - Habermas, Bhaskar, and Giddens all postulate 'social theory' as necessarily critical in nature and concerned with giving an 'accurate theoretical description of individual subjectivity, action, and social organization'.
- p.6
    - The commonalities amongst these theorists are a good example of W's idea of family resemblance.
    - **W postulates 'family resemblance' as a 'network of similarities overlapping and criss-crossing' and that this is how we can view different phenomena as connected, but also notes that there is no single essence or trait that all possess.** (_ibid_, see chapter 2, section IV)
    - Characteristics of all CST:
        1. maintain the enlightenment idea of the 'possibility and desirability of objectively valid scientific knowledge, which includes _social_ scientific knowledge.
            - Notes that in this way, critical theory is actually opposed to post-modernism and post-structuralism. There is value in these ideas, but CST's reject radical relativism.
        2. CST's incorporate many diverse schools of thought, including elements of W. The term 'critical' itself seems to mean reformulation and recombination of various theories and ideas.
        3. CST 'rejects positivism and empiricism as a false and outmoded philosophy and epistemology respectively.'
- p.7
    - Characteristics of CST (continued)
        4. 'Ontological elucidation' - the goal of CST is to provide a general theoretical account of the fundamental nature of individuals (subjectivity, action, agency, and knowledge, etc.) and social organization (structure, system, mechanisms, institutions, etc.). It is supposesd to be transcendent and 'one-size-fits-all'.
        5. Influence of 'post-positivist' philosophers of science like Popper, Kuhn, Polanyi. Bhaskar and Giddens can be considered realists in that they offer their theories as ontological in nature. They are presumed to be real and correct. Habermas is a bit different in that he advocates a stronger social constructionist epistemology - discourse theory of truth.
            - A few notes on 'realism'
                - Searle: 'realism is consistent with any theory of truth because it is a theory of ontology and not the meaning of "true"'.
                - Bhaskar: 'realism is not a theory of knowledge or truth, but of _being_'.
                - Likewise, even Habermas's theory of communicative action can be construed as ontological rather than epistemological because it relies on the presumed existence (ontology) of the 'objective world' or external reality, the social intersubjective world, and the individual's subjective world. IOW, still assumes on a representational view

- p.8
    - CST embraces the concept of fallibility: all knowledge claims are fallible.
    - However, CSTs also embrace (with the post-positivists) a certain 'ontological certainty'. CST's advocate _epistemological relativism_ and _ontological realism_.
        - so a social theorist can claim to "know 'ontologically' that social organization and individual subjectivity is constituted by certain structures, rules, mechanisms, powers, etc., of universal scope, whilst acknowledging that any particular account of this ontology is always (epistemoligcally) fallible and contingent."

- p.9
    - 'Conjuring trick' - CSTs want the best of both worlds and this is accomplished by giving ontological theory priority over epistemological problems.
        - **Is this what new materials, specifically Bryant, are guilty of? Solving alleged problems of epistemology by privileging ontology?**
    - Each of the CSTs that Pleasants discusses claim to be anti-essentialists. Pleasants argues that essentialism only applies to Cartesian and Kantian attempts to show undisputable 'epistemic foundations'.
    - 'Critical social theorists' interpretation of fallibilism therefore has the consequence of re-admitting a very close relation of foundationalism via the back door, as it were. Ontological realism is, in my view, simply an updated post-Cartesian/Kantian version of traditional foundationalism - it is an 'ontological foundationalism'.
    - **Why is essentialism bad, specifically in TC and PM?**

- p.25
    - _Immanent critique_ - demonstrates that a position is inadequate because of internal contradictions and absurdities.
        - position isn't wrong because it conflicts with one's own view of "how things really are" but rather because of problematic because of the "_proponent's_ standards and criteria for knowledge."
            - see W's private language argument.
    - The private language argument is, in fact, an argument 'against Cartesian and empiricist notions of epistemic privacy'.
        - But  it should not be taken as W's concept of a 'correct' vieew of mental experience.

- Keith p.28 - In case anyone (Scott) wants to argue that frameworks and foundations are what enables us to proceed, so to speak, there is Keith's contention via W that "once a theory has become a lens through we can see only part of the important evidence and examples, even armchair philosophizing goes astray."
- p.29
    - What is the problem with normative theories? (W rejects or displaces the normative component of linguistic and communication theory).
