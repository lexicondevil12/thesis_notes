### Evidence for the Conduit Metaphor

Appendix 
A partial listing of the metalingual resources of English

This appendix lists core expressions available in English to describe how verbal communication succeeds or fails.  It is divided into two parts. The first lists expressions arising from the logic of the conduit metaphor; the second lists expressions which are either metaphorically neutral or involve logics alternative to the conduit metaphor. Further search for expressions, along with a more elaborate means of analyzing and classifying, will be required before either collection can be termed complete. In some cases, in Part One, core expressions which I have placed in one category could with justification be placed in a different category as well. These and other niceties must await later exposition. One or two examples follow each expression.  Click below to see these lists.


##### Part One: The conduit metaphor


I. THE MAJOR FRAMEWORK

- **Bold** text indicates a repertoire member (RM)
- _italic_ text indicates a signal word (s)
    - See Reddy 289-290

**A. Implying that human language functions like a conduit enabling the transfer of repertoire members (RM) from one individual to another.**
| Index | Structure | Example1 | Example2 | Notes_Comments
| ----- | --------- | -------- | -------- | ------------- |
| 1. | get RM across (to someone) | “You’ll have to try to _get_ your real **attitudes** across to her better.” | “It’s very hard to _get_ that **idea** across in a hostile atmosphere.” |
| 2. | put RM across (to someone) | “If you salesmen can’t put this **understanding** _across_ to the clients more forcefully, our new product will fail.” |
| 3. | give RM (to someone) | “You know very well that I _gave_ you that **idea**.” |
| 4. | give RM away | “Jane _gives_ away all her best **ideas**.” |
| 5. | get RM from someone | “Marsha _got_ those **concepts** from Rudolf.” |  
| 6. | RM get through (to someone) | “Your real **feelings** are finally _getting through_ to me.”
| 7. | RM come through (to someone) | “Apparently, your **reasons** _came through_ to John quite _clearly_.” | “What _comes through_ most obviously is **anger**.” | * The word 'clearly' is further evidence - implies that ideas can be transmitted perfectly; in that sense it is also an (s) - sort of an ancillary or supplemental (s) |
| 8. | RM come across (to someone) | “Your **concepts** _come across_ beautifully.” |
| 9. | RM make it across (to someone) | “Your **thoughts** here don’t quite _make it across_.” |
| 10. | let someone have RM | “Oh come on, _let me have_ some of your great **ideas** about this.” |
| 11. | present someone with RM | “Well, you have _presented_ me with some unfamiliar **thoughts** and I think I should _let them_ settle awhile.” | | the 'let' in 'let them settle' also a (s)? |
| 12. | Send RM (to someone) | “Next time you write, _send_ better **ideas**.” |
| 13. | language transfers RM | “Language _transfers_ **meaning**.” |

**B. Implying that, in speaking or writing, humans place their internal repertoire members within the external signals, or else fail to do so in unsuccessful communication.**

- **Bold** text indicates a repertoire member (RM)
- _italic_ text indicates a signal word (s) - in this context, a (s) refers to "external physical patterns of marks, sounds, etc. that pass between speakers"
- Indicate "transmission" words with **_bold italic_** - these are any words that imply transmission and/or that words are "vessels" capable of containing and transmitting.
    - See Reddy 289-290

| Index | Structure | Example1 | Example2 | Notes_Comments
| ----- | --------- | -------- | -------- | ------------- |
| 14. | put RM into S | “It is very difficult to **_put_** this **concept** into _words_.” |
| 15. | capture RM in S | “When you have a good **idea**, try to capture it immediately in _words_.” |
| 16. | fill S with RM | “Harry always **_fills_** his _paragraphs_ with **meaning**.”
| 17. | pack S with RM | “A good poet **_packs_** his _lines_ with beautiful **feelings**.”
| 18. | pack RM into S | “If you can’t **_pack_** more **thought** into fewer _words_, you will never pass the conciseness test.” |
| 19. | load S with RM | “Never **_load_** a _sentence_ with more **thought** than it can **_carry_**.” | | 'carry' also implies containment and transmission |
| 20. | load RM into S | “John **_loads_** too much conflicting **feeling** into _what he says_.” | 
| 21. | insert RM in S | “**_Insert_** that **thought** elsewhere in the _sentence_.” |
| 22. | include RM in S | “I would certainly not **_include_** that **feeling** in your _speech_.” |
| 23. | burden S with RM | “You **_burden_** your _words_ with rather terribly complex **meanings**.” |
| 24. | overload S with RM | “Harry does not exactly **_overload_** his _paragraphs_ with **thought**.” |
| 25. | stuff RM into S | “You cannot simply **_stuff_** **ideas** into a _sentence_ any old way!” |
| 26. | stuff S with RM/full of RM | “You have only a short time, so try to **_stuff_** the _essay_ with all your best **ideas**.” | “You can **_stuff_** the _paper_ **_full_** of earthshaking **ideas**—that man still won’t notice.” | 
| 27. | cram RM into S | “Dickinson **_crams_** incredible amounts of **meaning** into her _poems_.” |
| 28. | cram with RM/full of RM | “He **_crammed_** the _speech_ with subversive **ideas**.” | “Harry **_crammed_** the _chapter_ full of spurious **arguments**.” |
| 29. | unload RM in S | “**_Unload_** your **feelings** in _words_—then your head will be clearer.” | | 'clearer' again implies that RMs can be transmitted flawlessly/perfectly from one head to another |
| 30. | force RM into S | “Don’t **_force_** your **meanings** **_into_** the wrong _words_.” |
| 31. | get RM into S | “I can’t seem to **_get_** these **ideas** into _words_.” |
| 32. | shove RM into S | “Trying to **_shove_** such complicated **meanings** into simple _sentences_ is exceedingly difficult.” |
| 33. | fit RM into S | "This **notion** does not seem to **_fit_** into any _words_.” |

**C. Implying that signals convey or contain the repertoire members, or else fail to do this in unsuccessful communication.**

- **Bold** text indicates a repertoire member (RM)
- _italic_ text indicates a signal word (s) - in this context, a (s) refers to "external physical patterns of marks, sounds, etc. that pass between speakers"
- Indicate "transmission" words with **_bold italic_** - these are any words that imply transmission and/or that words are "vessels" capable of containing and transmitting.
    - See Reddy 289-290

| Index | Structure | Example1 | Example2 | Example3 | Notes_Comments
| ----- | --------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | ------------- |
| 34. | S carry RM | “His _words_ **_carry_** little in the way of recognizable **meaning**.” |
| 35. | S convey RM | “The _passage_ **_conveys_** a **feeling** of excitement.” |
| 36. | S transfer RM | “Your _writing_ must **_transfer_** these **ideas** to those who need them.” |
| 37. | S display RM | “This _essay_ **_displays_** **thoughts** I did not think Marsha capable of.” |
| 38. | S bring RM (with it) | “His _letter_ **_brought_** the **idea** to the French pilots.” | 
| 39. | S contain RM | “In terms of the rest of the _poem_, your _couplet_ **_contains_** the wrong kind of **thoughts**.” |
| 40. | S have RM-content/RMa-content | “The _introduction_ **_has_** a great deal of **thought content**.” | “The _statement_ appears to **_have_** little **emotional content**.” | “The _speech_ **_has_** too much **angry content**.” | (“RMa” stands for adjectives appropriate to repertoire members.) |
| 41. | RM be in S | “That **thought** **_is in_** practically every _phrase_!” |
| 42. | S be pregnant with RM | “His _words_, **_pregnant with_** **meaning**, fell on receptive ears.” |
| 43. | S be fraught with RM | “The _poem_ **_is fraught with_** dire **thoughts** about civilization.” |
| 44. | S be saturated with RM | “The last _stanza_ **_is saturated with_** **despair**.”
| 45. | S be hollow | “Your _words_ **_seem_** rather hollow.” | | | Notable for absence of RM |
| 46. | S be full of RM | “The oracle’s _words_ **_were full_** of **meaning**.” | 
| 47. | S be without RM | “The _sentence_ **_is without_** **meaning**.” |
| 48. | S have no RM | “Sam’s _words_ **_have not_** the slightest **feeling** of compassion.” |
| 49. | S be empty (of RM)| “His _lines_ may rhyme, but they **_are empty_** of either **meaning** or **feeling**.” | “The _sentences_ **_are empty_**; they say nothing to me.” | “_What the candidates have said_ **_is so much empty_** sound.” | Again refers to absence of RM |
| 50. | S be void of RM | “The entire _chapter_ **_is void_** of all useful **ideas**.” |
| 51. | S’s RM/RM of S | “The **thought** of this _clause_ is somehow disturbing.” | “This _paragraph_’s **thought** is completely garbled.” |
| 52. | S be bursting with RM | “The _poem_ **_is bursting_** with **ecstasy**!” |
| 53. | S be overflowing with RM | “The _line_ is **_overflowing_** with pure **happiness**.” |
| 54. |  RM show up in S | “This **idea** **_shows up_** in the second _paragraph_.” |
| 55. | S hand RM (to someone) | “But this _sentence_ **_hands_** us a completely different **idea**.” |

**D. Implying that, in listening or reading, humans find repertoire members within the signals and take them into their heads, or else fail to do so in unsuccessful communication.**

- **Bold** text indicates a repertoire member (RM)
- _italic_ text indicates a signal word (s) - in this context, a (s) refers to "external physical patterns of marks, sounds, etc. that pass between speakers"
- Indicate "transmission" words with **_bold italic_** - these are any words that imply transmission and/or that words are "vessels" capable of containing and transmitting.
    - See Reddy 289-290

| Index | Structure | Example1 | Example2 | Example3 | Notes_Comments
| ----- | --------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | ------------- |
| 56. | get RM out of S/from S | “I have to struggle to **_get_** any **meaning** at all **_out of_** the _sentence_.” | “I **_got_** the **idea** of patience from your _statement_.” |
| 57. | get the RM in S into one’s head | “Everybody must **_get_** the **concepts** in this _article_ **_into_** his head by tomorrow or else!” |
| 58. | extract RM from S | “Can you really **_extract_** coherent **thoughts** **_from_** that incredible _prose_?” |
| 59. | RM arise from S | “The **feeling** **_arises from_** the second _paragraph_.” |
| 60. | see RM in S | “We will **_see_** this **thought** several times again **_in_** the _sonnet_.” |
| 61. | find RM in S | “John says that he cannot **_find_** your **idea** anywhere **_in_** the _passage_.” |
| 63. | [sic] Come upon RM in S | “I would be quite surprised if you **_came upon_** any interesting **concepts** in Stephen’s _essay_.” |
| 64. | uncover RM in S | “John admits that we **_uncovered_** those **ideas** in the _ode_, but still doesn’t believe that **_Keats put_** **them** _there_.” | | | 'them' refers to the RM **ideas**; 'there' refers to the (s) _ode_ |
| 65. | overlook RM in S | “Don’t **_overlook_** the **idea of fulfilled passion** later on in the _passage_.” |
| 66. | pay attention to RM in S/what’s in S | “You rarely **_pay enough attention_** to the actual **meaning** in the _words_.” | “Please **_pay attention_** to **what’s there** in the _words_!” |
| 67. | reveal RM in S | “Closer reading **_reveals_** altogether uncharacteristic **feelings** in the _story_.” | 
| 68. | miss RM in S | “I **_missed_** that **idea** in the _sentence_ completely.” | 
| 69. | S be impenetrable | “The _poem_ is **meant** to be impenetrable—after all, Blake wrote it.” | | | Indicates absence of RM, but **meant** could be argued to implied intentionality - whatever mental mechanisms are involved with being purposefully obtuse. |
| 70. | RM be locked up in S | “**Whatever she meant**, **it’s** likely to be **_locked up_** in that cryptic little _verse_ forever.” | | | In this case "**Whatever she meant**" is the RM | 
| 71. | RM be sealed up in S | “It’s as if he wrote the _sentences_ in such a way as **_to seal up_** the **meaning** in _them_.” | | | 'them' refers to the (s) _sentences_ |
| 72. | RM be hidden (away) in S | “The **attitudes** I want to show you **_are hidden_** away someplace in the last _chapter_.” | | | This example is particularly interesting: the phrase 'I want to show you' combined with 'hidden away' implies the RM (**attitudes**) we intentionally obscured **_within_** the (s)/vessel (IOW, the _chapter_). |
| 73. | RM be/get lost in S | “Mary has good **ideas**, but **they** **_get lost in_** her run-on _sentences_.” | | | Again, interesting because this all but directly implies that **ideas** can be lost or concealed **_within_** signals (s) (_sentences_, in this case) |
| 74. | RM be buried in S | “Yes, but the man’s **thought** **_is buried in_** these terribly dense and difficult _paragraphs_.” | | | Again, RM can be obscured **_in_** signals/(s)/words - i.e. ideas, thoughts, can be placed inside words for multiple purposes; frequently this purpose is obfuscation. |
| 75. | RM be sunk in S | “The **thought** is _there_, although I grant that it’s **_sunk pretty deep in_** paradoxical _language_.” | | | 'there' refers to the (s) - the language that the RM is "sunk" in. |
| 76. | lay bare RM in S | “John’s _analysis_ really **_lays bare_** the **ideas** in the _chapter_.” | | | '_analysis_' and '_chapter_' both indicate (s)'s - the vessels in which mental components are contained and transmitted. |
| 77. | bare RM in S | “You **_have bared_** the hidden **meanings** in the _sentence_.” | 
| 78. | unseal RM in S | “To **_unseal_** the **meaning** in Wittgenstein’s curious _phrases_ is no easy task.” |
| 79. | expose RM in S | “You have **_exposed_** certain **feelings** in the _essay_ of which the author would not be proud.”



##### II. THE MINOR FRAMEWORK

- **Bold** text indicates a repertoire member (RM)
- _italic_ text denotes a word that refers to the RM being "out" in some external space
    - see Reddy 291 

| Index | Structure | Example1 | Example2 | Example3 | Notes_Comments

| 85. | pour RM forth | “You come over and _pour forth_ your **anger** and expect me to _take it all in_!” | | | 'take it all in' refers to the fact that once RM has been put into the "idea space" it may or may not be picked up, absorbed, etc. by someone else |
| 86. | bring RM out | “Dr. Williams _brings out_ some unusual **thoughts** on the matter.” | 
| 87. | S put RM forth | “IBM’s legal brief _puts forth_ the **idea** that they have been mistreated.” |
| 88. | S brings RM out | “The essay _brings out_ unusual **thoughts** on the matter.” |

| 92. | put RM down on paper | “Perhaps you could _put_ this **feeling** of sympathy _down on paper_ and **_send_** it to your brother.” | | | This is interesting and somewhat unusual as it still references the idea of "sending" an RM; IOW transmitting |
| 93. | set RM down on paper | “Can you _set_ the latest **idea** _down on paper_ and let me take it?” |
| 94. | lay RM out on paper | “_Lay_ your **thoughts** _out on paper_ where you can see them.” |

| 100. | RM gush out/forth | “Let your **emotions** _gush right out_—that’s what we’re here for.” | “All these **thoughts** can’t _gush forth_ at once, you know.” |
| 101. | RM ooze out | “Her **sympathy** just _oozes out_.” |
| 102. | RM escape someone’s lips | “That **idea** will never _escape_ Mary’s lips.” |
| 103. | throw out RM | “I just want to _throw out_ some new **ideas** for you folks to look at.” |
| 104. | throw RM EX LOC | “You can’t just _throw_ **ideas** **_onto the page_** any old way!” | “Mary _throws_ her **ideas** at the reader too fast.” | | (EX LOC stands for external locative, that is, any expression denoting a place external to the speaker’s or writer’s head.) |
| 105. | toss out RM | “I shall begin the class by _tossing out_ some apparently very simple **thoughts**.” |
| 106. | blurt out RM | “You always _blurt out_ your **feelings** before anyone is ready to cope with them.” |

**F. Implying that repertoire members are reified in this external “space,” independent of any need for living humans to think or feel them.**

- **Bold** text indicates a repertoire member (RM)
- _italic_ text denotes a word that refers to the RM being "out" in some external space
- **_Bold italic_** indicates either EX LOC (see example 104), L (see example 114), B (see example 116) - basically indicates an external space or object that an RM can occupy

| 116. | find RM in B | “You can _find_ that **idea** in several **_books_**.” | | |(B stands for those physical objects that normally contain writing—i.e., “magazines,” “newspapers,” etc., and also expressions like “on microfilm.”) |

#### Part Two: Other metalingual resources

Many of the expressions below can be used with common adjuncts to form statements that support the conduit metaphor. Thus, it is only when they are used without these adjuncts that they can be thought of as alternatives. To make this apparent, I shall present starred examples (*) which show how easily the neutrality of these expressions can be lost. There are also expressions which appear to involve the conduit metaphor in one reading, but not in another. These I shall flag with a question mark.

(It appears that we make up for the poverty of this category by reusing many Category I expressions with S words, as opposed to humans, as subjects. Thus, “John’s words tell us of his ideas,” or “This sentence states your thoughts plainly.” Whether this personification of the signals is linked to the conduit metaphor or not, I have not yet determined. The conduit metaphor does view words as containing ideas just as humans do, however, which could provide motivation for the transfer. That is, the signals could be “giving us the ideas they contain,” just as, in speaking, humans “give us the ideas they contain.” This question will have to await deeper analysis.)
