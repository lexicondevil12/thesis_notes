###Meeting with Bill 4/4/17

 - Send proposal to Bill before Tues
 - create list of issues, topics, items to address


####Issues, Topic, Items

 - How to explain/write about Wittgenstein
	 - Where to start
 - How to explain representation and trasnmission
	 - what are some good sources?
 - Pleasants 
	 - immanent critique
	 -  anti-theory
	 - anti-essentialism
 - Once I've explained W, language games, family resemblance, forms of life (especially need help with this - still don't really understand what this means): 
	 - how should I proceed?
	 - What should my methodology be?
		 - critique the traditional PM doctrine (i.e. PMBOK)?
		 - critque agile doctrine and other 'iterative' methodologies
			 - 18F and MKE digital services playbook
		 - Show how W can be used to understand and maybe even improve?
		 - Real world examples and case studies?
			 - again MKE playbook and 18F
			 - also 'Experimental modes in Civic Engagement and Civic Tech' by LaurenEllen McCann
	 - Do the same critique for tech comm theory??
		 - Schatzki's critique of Giddens and Bourdieu
		 - Pleasants's critique of Giddens, Habermas, critical social theory in general 
	

 
 - Essentially, my thesis is: Traditional, linear PM methodologies are too rigid to address the complex interactions between various stakeholders in modern technology projects because they evince representational and transmission-based views of language and communication.
 - I want to extend Cockburn's idea of agile development as 'a game of invention and communication'.
	 - Recast Cockburn's usages of the term 'invention' as the rhetorical canon of invention
		 - resource for discussion of rhetorical invention?
	 - And, obviously, communication in W's sense
	 - Then bring in McCann's discussion of 'civic engagement in civic tech'
 
 ### Bottom line: **Structure, Structure, Structure** - How do I organize this??


 - Other items to maybe consider/include:
	 - Rorty
	 - Quine and Davidson
	 - habermas's technocracy
