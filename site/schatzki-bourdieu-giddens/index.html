                <h2 id="practices-and-actions-wittgensteinian-critique-of-bourdieu-and-giddens">Practices and Actions - Wittgensteinian Critique of Bourdieu and Giddens</h2>
<p><strong>289 - Critique of Bourdieu</strong>
<em> "...it is not with practices but with the objective conditions established by them that dispositions are </em>homologously<em> structured."
</em> For Bourdieu, these objective conditions have two dimensions:
    * <strong>statistical regularities</strong> - such as price curves, chances of access to education, frequency of holidays
    * <strong>networks of groups</strong> are defined by
        * possession of certain cultural, symbolic, and material capitals
        * pursuit of certain actions and lifestyles
            * Economic class is especially important</p>
<p><strong>290</strong>
* "It is logically wiser to postulate that habitus is srtuctured homologously with the action manifolds it produces."</p>
<p><strong>290 - Giddens</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"A practice is a nexus of actions...The renewal of structure whereby practices perpetuate themselves must come about through the actions that compose them"</em>
* Actors in a field of practices, thought their participation in practicesm reinforce and reproduce the structures that hence organize practices.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As Schatzki writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"...actors draw on structures, thereby participating in practices and reinterating their own organizing structures. Hence, the structures of practices also govern practices' constituent actions."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>291</strong>
* Giddens understanding of structure:
    1. Rules
    2. Resources - the medium through which social power is enacted. Giddens notes that social power is understood here as the capacity to bring about change in a situation where doing so is subject to the actions of others. This seems (to me at least) to be Giddens account of agency. <strong>In this way, we can say more directly that use of a resource is the act of securing the actions of other required to bring about an outcome.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>So structure both organizes and governs actions (that make up practices)  is itself made up of <strong>sets of rules</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>rules</strong> are codes and norms, which are "methodologically applied" and "generalizable procedures of action" that arise from the practical activities of daily life (we could paraphrase to say that rules are norms that arise from "going about" one's daily activities). It is through repeated observance of these rules (largely determined by dispositions inculcated by cultural upbringing, societal/cultural pressure or judgment, and the act(s) repeated observance themselves) that these rules are codified, so to speak, although it seems neither Giddens nor Wittgenstein construe the process by which rules are developed and perpetuated that concretely. As Schatzki notes, Giddens was careful to observe that rules are always only "interpreted." "Rules themselves are procedures of action, ways of going on" (Schatzki 1997, p. 291). We see here the similarities in the phrase "ways of going on" and W's understanding of practices and rules as "what it makes sense to do".</li>
<li><strong>Resources</strong><ul>
<li>"Through the use of or reliance on resources, actors bring others to perform actions through which specific outcomes are secured."</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>292 - Bourdieu v. Giddens</strong>
<em> For Bourdieu, habitus alone is what determines action.
</em> Giddens maintains that actions can also be determined by reasons (the unspoken grounds for actions) and desires (deep, perhaps subconscous motivations).</p>
<p><strong>292-93</strong>
<em> <strong>Summary of Bourdieu's system of oppostions</strong>:
    1. organize practices by structuring arrays of actions - what is done, when, and where.
    2. determine actions by structuring the selection of (sensible) actions
</em> For Bourdieu, the identity of an action stems from oppositions that organize practices.
<em> <strong>Summary of Giddens:</strong>
    * Rules and resources:
        1. govern practices by defining fields of possible actions.
        2. determine what actions are possible via a practical consciousness that situates/orients activity
</em> For Giddens, an actions receive at least part of its identity from the organization of the practice of which it is a part.</p>
<h4 id="for-both-practices-are-ontologically-prior-to-actions-and-the-existence-of-individual-actions-are-bound-up-with-manifolds-of-activity"><strong>For both, practices are ontologically prior to actions and the existence of individual actions are bound up with manifolds of activity.</strong></h4>
<h3 id="what-the-eff-are-manifolds"><strong>What the eff are manifolds?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>294</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Giddens and Bourdieu contest the adequacy of representationism as a complete or even partial account of human activity and seek to do justice to the practice nature of action by rooting human activity in a norepresentational stratum, which also undergirds the resultingly limited role that representations play in determining action."</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>representational approaches are being replaced with conceptions that acknowledge "creative action." So non-rep accounts believe that representations play at most a limited role in determining actions. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>295</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Powerful considerations against the possibility of representing the content of practical understanding, the ability to go on intelligibly to others, are found in the works of Wittgenstein. Most discussions of the bearing of his texts on practical understanding fcus on his remarks about rule following, where a rule is an explicit formulation. * <strong>The considerations that argue against representability of practical understandings, on the other hand, are found in his disucssion of games and family resemblances</strong> * (e.g., Wittgenstein 1958, sec 65-79)."</p>
<p>Collapsing, or even just decentering, the determination of action in practical understanding represents a great advance over representational models of activity. Representationism is burdened by lingering, if not overtly, Neo-Cartesian conceptions of representation; by the baneful assumption that mental conditions are discrete states in any sense stronger than being described in specific words; and/or by indadequately explicated notion of causal relations between representations and actions. (Schatzki, 1997)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PI Sec. 49</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Name is not yet a move in a language game...with the mere naming of a thing, nothing has yet been done. Nor <em>has</em> it a name except in a game. This is what Frege meant too when he said that a word has a meaning only in the context of a sentence." {Emphasis in original}</p>
