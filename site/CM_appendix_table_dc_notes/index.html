<p>Appendix 
A partial listing of the metalingual resources of English</p>
<p>This appendix lists core expressions available in English to describe how verbal communication succeeds or fails.  It is divided into two parts. The first lists expressions arising from the logic of the conduit metaphor; the second lists expressions which are either metaphorically neutral or involve logics alternative to the conduit metaphor. Further search for expressions, along with a more elaborate means of analyzing and classifying, will be required before either collection can be termed complete. In some cases, in Part One, core expressions which I have placed in one category could with justification be placed in a different category as well. These and other niceties must await later exposition. One or two examples follow each expression.  Click below to see these lists.</p>
<h5 id="part-one-the-conduit-metaphor">Part One: The conduit metaphor</h5>
<p>I. THE MAJOR FRAMEWORK</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bold</strong> text indicates a repertoire member (RM)</li>
<li><em>italic</em> text indicates a signal word (s)<ul>
<li>See Reddy 289-290</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A. Implying that human language functions like a conduit enabling the transfer of repertoire members (RM) from one individual to another.</strong>
| Index | Structure | Example1 | Example2 | Notes_Comments
| ----- | --------- | -------- | -------- | ------------- |
| 1. | get RM across (to someone) | “You’ll have to try to <em>get</em> your real <strong>attitudes</strong> across to her better.” | “It’s very hard to <em>get</em> that <strong>idea</strong> across in a hostile atmosphere.” |
| 2. | put RM across (to someone) | “If you salesmen can’t put this <strong>understanding</strong> <em>across</em> to the clients more forcefully, our new product will fail.” |
| 3. | give RM (to someone) | “You know very well that I <em>gave</em> you that <strong>idea</strong>.” |
| 4. | give RM away | “Jane <em>gives</em> away all her best <strong>ideas</strong>.” |
| 5. | get RM from someone | “Marsha <em>got</em> those <strong>concepts</strong> from Rudolf.” |<br />
| 6. | RM get through (to someone) | “Your real <strong>feelings</strong> are finally <em>getting through</em> to me.”
| 7. | RM come through (to someone) | “Apparently, your <strong>reasons</strong> <em>came through</em> to John quite <em>clearly</em>.” | “What <em>comes through</em> most obviously is <strong>anger</strong>.” | * The word 'clearly' is further evidence - implies that ideas can be transmitted perfectly; in that sense it is also an (s) - sort of an ancillary or supplemental (s) |
| 8. | RM come across (to someone) | “Your <strong>concepts</strong> <em>come across</em> beautifully.” |
| 9. | RM make it across (to someone) | “Your <strong>thoughts</strong> here don’t quite <em>make it across</em>.” |
| 10. | let someone have RM | “Oh come on, <em>let me have</em> some of your great <strong>ideas</strong> about this.” |
| 11. | present someone with RM | “Well, you have <em>presented</em> me with some unfamiliar <strong>thoughts</strong> and I think I should <em>let them</em> settle awhile.” | | the 'let' in 'let them settle' also a (s)? |
| 12. | Send RM (to someone) | “Next time you write, <em>send</em> better <strong>ideas</strong>.” |
| 13. | language transfers RM | “Language <em>transfers</em> <strong>meaning</strong>.” |</p>
<p><strong>B. Implying that, in speaking or writing, humans place their internal repertoire members within the external signals, or else fail to do so in unsuccessful communication.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bold</strong> text indicates a repertoire member (RM)</li>
<li><em>italic</em> text indicates a signal word (s) - in this context, a (s) refers to "external physical patterns of marks, sounds, etc. that pass between speakers"</li>
<li>Indicate "transmission" words with <strong><em>bold italic</em></strong> - these are any words that imply transmission and/or that words are "vessels" capable of containing and transmitting.<ul>

<p>Many of the expressions below can be used with common adjuncts to form statements that support the conduit metaphor. Thus, it is only when they are used without these adjuncts that they can be thought of as alternatives. To make this apparent, I shall present starred examples (*) which show how easily the neutrality of these expressions can be lost. There are also expressions which appear to involve the conduit metaphor in one reading, but not in another. These I shall flag with a question mark.</p>

<p><strong>II. Alternatives to Categories IC and IF of the Conduit Metaphor: Expressions which do not imply that words contain or convey meanings, or that ideas exist independent of human beings in an abstract “space.”</strong>
33. S symbolize RM 
“Words symbolize meanings.”
“Gestures can symbolize various emotions.”
34. S correspond to RM 
“The sentence corresponds to mythoughts.”
35. S stand for RM 
“Sentences stand for human thoughts.”
?36. S represent RM 
“Language represents our thoughts and feelings.”
?37. S mean/have meanings (to someone)
“I hope my words mean something to you.”
(It appears that we make up for the poverty of this category by reusing many Category I expressions with S words, as opposed to humans, as subjects. Thus, “John’s words tell us of his ideas,” or “This sentence states your thoughts plainly.” Whether this personification of the signals is linked to the conduit metaphor or not, I have not yet determined. The conduit metaphor does view words as containing ideas just as humans do, however, which could provide motivation for the transfer. That is, the signals could be “giving us the ideas they contain,” just as, in speaking, humans “give us the ideas they contain.” This question will have to await deeper analysis.)</p>
<p><strong>III. Alternatives to Categories ID and IG of the Conduit Metaphor: Expressions which do not imply that reading and listening are acts of extraction, or that reified ideas re-enter human heads from an abstract “space.”</strong>
38. understand S/RM—but not <em>understand RM in S 
“I have some trouble understanding the sentence.”
“I can rarely understand his thoughts.”
</em>“I have never understood the meaning in that essay.”
39. comprehend S/RM—but not <em>comprehend RM in S 
“Have you comprehended the sentence?”
“She does not comprehend my thoughts.”
</em>“John comprehends few of the thoughts in Mary’s paper.”
?40. grasp S—but not <em>grasp RM or </em>grasp RM in S 
“I have not yet grasped the sentence.”
*“I have had little time to grasp his thoughts, especially the
meaning in the last chapter.”
41. construct a reading for S 
“It is easy to construct a reading for that sentence.”
42. build a reading for S 
“How do you build readings for sentences like that?”
?43. get reading for S 
“How did you get that reading for that phrase?”
?44. interpret S 
“I find it hard to interpret his paragraphs.”
45. follow S 
“I could follow his sentences easily.”</p>
