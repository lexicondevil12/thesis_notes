Assumptions about the function of communication in traditional, linear PM methodologies become problematic because they evince representational and transmission-based conceptions of communication that are too rigid to address the complexity of the interactions between various groups in modern technology projects (Cimcil, McKay et al., Vann).

The human mind takes this sensory data and uses language to describe it. The best descriptions are those that appear to most closely 'mirror' the external world. Transmission is the idea a concept in the mind of one person (the sender) can be transmitted through language to another person's mind (the receiver), and that the receiver can interpret the language to recreate idea as it existed in the sender's mind.\n\n\nTo accomplish this re-thinking of TPC and PM, I will examine theories and practices from both through the lens of Ludwig Wittgenstein\u2019s contributions to communication theory and show that this approach can add valuable insight into what technical communicators can contribute in PM scenarios. In his critique of representational and transmission-based views of language and communication, Wittgenstein argued that perceived problems of knowledge and meaning stem from misunderstanding how language works. Wittgenstein suggests that meaning is entirely contextual and is generated socially through interconnected actions and behaviors (Keith, Pleasants, Schatzki). There is some contention that agile and other iterative methodologies don't, strictly speaking, qualify as PM approaches, but I suggest that the spirit of Wittgenstein's concept of family resemblances allows us to rearticulate the role of technical communicators in modern technology project situations: Technical communicators can combine their rhetorical training (particular the invention canon) with a Wittgensteinian understanding of communication to function as better facilitators of communication and ultimately better PMs.",

This is a representational view.\n\n\nWords can't get their meaning because they reference a specific thing in the world, this would require a word to refer to something more general like a concept of idea, which then raises the problem of \nwhat\n exactly those things are and \nwhere\n there are to be located.\n\n\nThis requires a \"representational\" explanation: 'words are signs of concepts, and concepts are probably mental phenomena.'\n\n\nW cites an example from Augustine - Children learn the names of things by repeatedly observing others refer to objects by those names. They then learn to use their mouths to form and say the names of things to express their own desires. (PI \u00a71)\n\n\nW summarizes it thusly: individual words in a language name objects. These names are then used to construct sentences. \"Every word has a meaning and the meaning correlates with the word: It (the meaning) is the object for which the word stands.' (PI \u00a71)\n\n\nSo, W needs to outline a situation or example that doesn't equate naming and meaning.\n\n\nWorth noting that here Keith does not use the term theory or explanation: W needs to provide an example or scenario and build upon it.

He isn't refusing to give an answer, he is noting that knowing the \nshopkeeper's inner mental state simply isn't required to derive the meaning, all we need is the act of him doing it - the meaning is in the behavior, the act of carrying out.\n\n\nPeople do things with language (and stuff in the world), and their doings exhibit regularity. Nothing more is needed to explain what is going on, not concepts in people's heads, or meanings, or psychological states - which is not to say that Augustine's picture is wrong, but just radically incomplete as a guide to how language works.

            "text": "Wittgenstein and Critical Theory - Introduction\n\n\n\n\nII: Wittgenstein Against Theory\n\n\np.2\n\n\nWe treat W in one of 2 ways:\n\n\nas a radically new method for giving accurate descriptions of certain phenomena\n\n\n'we may not advance any kind of theory. There must not be anything hypothetical in our considerations. We must do away with all \nexplanation\n.'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMutually exclusive: we can't say that we should avoid explanatory theories and claim to provide more accurate descriptions of phenomena.\n\n\nBecause of this, most people ignore the 'anti-theoretical' part of W's thought, and furthermore try to extract philosophical theories and 'ontological' insight.\n\n\nThe 'anti-theoretical' strain is ignored as unscientific.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nW claims no special insight into social and political reality.\n    \n- Again, what is the value of this approach for TC and PM?\n\n\n\n\n\n\np.3\n\n\nW is concerned with a very particular kind of theorizing activity: providing 'pictures' of phenomena. \nHow is this different that providing explanations?\n\n\n'a particular picture of the essence of human language.'\n\n\n\"A philosophical picture, in Wittgenstein's sense, is a theoretical representation which has \nlost its representational status\n and has been reified into a peculiarly compelling portrayal of the \nessence of some phenomena\n. Such pictures are really only \nmetaphors, analogies, and representations\n, but they are \nexperienced as knowledge of the essence of reality-in-itelf\n: 'we predicate of the thing what lies in the method of representing it' (\nibid\n ss.104 \nPI\n). The compulsion is psychological as well as intellectual. When transfixed by a philosophical picture of some phenomena-such as, for example, the nature of 'mind', 'consciousness', 'self', and 'language', et. - we feel as thoughwe can see \ndirectly\n (not just 'theoretically') how these things \nmust\n be, inherently, in and of themselves.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthese picutres that W mentions are really better described as states of affairs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\np.4\n\n\nW's critique is directed at these metonymical and metaphorical explanations.\n\n\nHow do representational, metaphorical, metonymmical theories manifest in TC and what are the effects?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nex. the brain metonymically represents non-physical phenomena such as 'mind' and 'consciousness'.\n\n\nYet, ordinary language is frequently metaphorical, etc. and W doesn't say that there is anything wrong with this since we do not purport to strive for some perfect, transcendent, perfect form of language.\n\n\nPhilosophers, on the other hand, end up deluded into thinking exactly that: that various theories and forms of thought do offer something essential, transcendent, and in some cases, scientific.\n\n\n\n\n\n\np.5\n\n\nW can be seen as engaging in a certain kind of 'ideology-critique'\n\n\nThis is possibly very important - W's thought can be used to critique the idea of the possibility of theory itself. Maybe this is the value - TC's can use it to critique other pervasive or entrenched schools of thought within TC and PM.\n\n\nThis therapeutic method is called for because of the peculiar 'depth' (Wittgenstein 1968:ss.111) of entrenchment and compelling force of so many of the dominant pictures in philosophical discourse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs such, I can use W's ideas to critique TC but not to suggest that whatever I come up with is a superior theoretical understanding.\n\n\nSo for my proposal, I can argue that looking at TC and PM from a Wittgensteinian perspective is valuable because:\n\n\nIt is another tool or set of tools for critiquing dogma, status quo, and entrenched ideas in TC.\n\n\nW's understanding of language and communication can be helpful for rethinking and perhaps even improving communnication in small development teams, and perhaps even moreso in the realm of civil tech projects, where the goal is to 'build \nwith\n rather than \nfor\n'. Also help TC's and other tech workers communicate in a more effective and respectful way to the communities and individuals they collaborate with.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIII: Critical Social Theory:  the new consensus\n\n- p.5\n    - Critical Social Theory (CST) is concerned with identifying 'theorectical representations' of 'structures, rules, mechanisms, and power' that shape the social, individual agency, etc.\n    - Habermas, Bhaskar, and Giddens all postulate 'social theory' as necessarily critical in nature and concerned with giving an 'accurate theoretical description of individual subjectivity, action, and social organization'.\n- p.6\n    - The commonalities amongst these theorists are a good example of W's idea of family resemblance.\n    - \nW postulates 'family resemblance' as a 'network of similarities overlapping and criss-crossing' and that this is how we can view different phenomena as connected, but also notes that there is no single essence or trait that all possess.\n (\nibid\n, see chapter 2, section IV)\n    - Characteristics of all CST:\n        1. maintain the enlightenment idea of the 'possibility and desirability of objectively valid scientific knowledge, which includes \nsocial\n scientific knowledge.\n            - Notes that in this way, critical theory is actually opposed to post-modernism and post-structuralism. There is value in these ideas, but CST's reject radical relativism.\n        2. CST's incorporate many diverse schools of thought, including elements of W. The term 'critical' itself seems to mean reformulation and recombination of various theories and ideas.\n        3. CST 'rejects positivism and empiricism as a false and outmoded philosophy and epistemology respectively.'\n- p.7\n    - Characteristics of CST (continued)\n        4. 'Ontological elucidation' - the goal of CST is to provide a general theoretical account of the fundamental nature of individuals (subjectivity, action, agency, and knowledge, etc.) and social organization (structure, system, mechanisms, institutions, etc.). It is supposesd to be transcendent and 'one-size-fits-all'.\n        5. Influence of 'post-positivist' philosophers of science like Popper, Kuhn, Polanyi. Bhaskar and Giddens can be considered realists in that they offer their theories as ontological in nature. They are presumed to be real and correct.

            "text": "II: Wittgenstein Against Theory  p.2  We treat W in one of 2 ways:  as a radically new method for giving accurate descriptions of certain phenomena  'we may not advance any kind of theory. There must not be anything hypothetical in our considerations. We must do away with all  explanation .'    Mutually exclusive: we can't say that we should avoid explanatory theories and claim to provide more accurate descriptions of phenomena.  Because of this, most people ignore the 'anti-theoretical' part of W's thought, and furthermore try to extract philosophical theories and 'ontological' insight.  The 'anti-theoretical' strain is ignored as unscientific.    W claims no special insight into social and political reality.\n     - Again, what is the value of this approach for TC and PM?    p.3  W is concerned with a very particular kind of theorizing activity: providing 'pictures' of phenomena.  How is this different that providing explanations?  'a particular picture of the essence of human language.'  \"A philosophical picture, in Wittgenstein's sense, is a theoretical representation which has  lost its representational status  and has been reified into a peculiarly compelling portrayal of the  essence of some phenomena . Such pictures are really only  metaphors, analogies, and representations , but they are  experienced as knowledge of the essence of reality-in-itelf : 'we predicate of the thing what lies in the method of representing it' ( ibid  ss.104  PI ). The compulsion is psychological as well as intellectual. When transfixed by a philosophical picture of some phenomena-such as, for example, the nature of 'mind', 'consciousness', 'self', and 'language', et. - we feel as thoughwe can see  directly  (not just 'theoretically') how these things  must  be, inherently, in and of themselves.\"      these picutres that W mentions are really better described as states of affairs.    p.4  W's critique is directed at these metonymical and metaphorical explanations.  How do representational, metaphorical, metonymmical theories manifest in TC and what are the effects?    ex. the brain metonymically represents non-physical phenomena such as 'mind' and 'consciousness'.  Yet, ordinary language is frequently metaphorical, etc. and W doesn't say that there is anything wrong with this since we do not purport to strive for some perfect, transcendent, perfect form of language.  Philosophers, on the other hand, end up deluded into thinking exactly that: that various theories and forms of thought do offer something essential, transcendent, and in some cases, scientific.    p.5  W can be seen as engaging in a certain kind of 'ideology-critique'  This is possibly very important - W's thought can be used to critique the idea of the possibility of theory itself. Maybe this is the value - TC's can use it to critique other pervasive or entrenched schools of thought within TC and PM.  This therapeutic method is called for because of the peculiar 'depth' (Wittgenstein 1968:ss.111) of entrenchment and compelling force of so many of the dominant pictures in philosophical discourse.      As such, I can use W's ideas to critique TC but not to suggest that whatever I come up with is a superior theoretical understanding.  So for my proposal, I can argue that looking at TC and PM from a Wittgensteinian perspective is valuable because:  It is another tool or set of tools for critiquing dogma, status quo, and entrenched ideas in TC.  W's understanding of language and communication can be helpful for rethinking and perhaps even improving communnication in small development teams, and perhaps even moreso in the realm of civil tech projects, where the goal is to 'build  with  rather than  for '. Also help TC's and other tech workers communicate in a more effective and respectful way to the communities and individuals they collaborate with.       III: Critical Social Theory:  the new consensus \n- p.5\n    - Critical Social Theory (CST) is concerned with identifying 'theorectical representations' of 'structures, rules, mechanisms, and power' that shape the social, individual agency, etc.\n    - Habermas, Bhaskar, and Giddens all postulate 'social theory' as necessarily critical in nature and concerned with giving an 'accurate theoretical description of individual subjectivity, action, and social organization'.\n- p.6\n    - The commonalities amongst these theorists are a good example of W's idea of family resemblance.\n    -  W postulates 'family resemblance' as a 'network of similarities overlapping and criss-crossing' and that this is how we can view different phenomena as connected, but also notes that there is no single essence or trait that all possess.  ( ibid , see chapter 2, section IV)\n    - Characteristics of all CST:\n        1. maintain the enlightenment idea of the 'possibility and desirability of objectively valid scientific knowledge, which includes  social  scientific knowledge.\n            - Notes that in this way, critical theory is actually opposed to post-modernism and post-structuralism. There is value in these ideas, but CST's reject radical relativism.\n        2. CST's incorporate many diverse schools of thought, including elements of W. The term 'critical' itself seems to mean reformulation and recombination of various theories and ideas.\n        3. CST 'rejects positivism and empiricism as a false and outmoded philosophy and epistemology respectively.'\n- p.7\n    - Characteristics of CST (continued)\n        4. 'Ontological elucidation' - the goal of CST is to provide a general theoretical account of the fundamental nature of individuals (subjectivity, action, agency, and knowledge, etc.) and social organization (structure, system, mechanisms, institutions, etc.). It is supposesd to be transcendent and 'one-size-fits-all'.\n        5. Influence of 'post-positivist' philosophers of science like Popper, Kuhn, Polanyi. Bhaskar and Giddens can be considered realists in that they offer their theories as ontological in nature. They are presumed to be real and correct. Habermas is a bit different in that he advocates a stronger social constructionist epistemology - discourse theory of truth.\n            - A few notes on 'realism'\n                - Searle: 'realism is consistent with any theory of truth because it is a theory of ontology and not the meaning of \"true\"'.\n                - Bhaskar: 'realism is not a theory of knowledge or truth, but of  being '.\n                - Likewise, even Habermas's theory of communicative action can be construed as ontological rather than epistemological because it relies on the presumed existence (ontology) of the 'objective world' or external reality, the social intersubjective world, and the individual's subjective world. IOW, still assumes on a representational view    p.8   CST embraces the concept of fallibility: all knowledge claims are fallible.  However, CSTs also embrace (with the post-positivists) a certain 'ontological certainty'. CST's advocate  epistemological relativism  and  ontological realism .  so a social theorist can claim to \"know 'ontologically' that social organization and individual subjectivity is constituted by certain structures, rules, mechanisms, powers, etc., of universal scope, whilst acknowledging that any particular account of this ontology is always (epistemoligcally) fallible and contingent.\"       p.9   'Conjuring trick' - CSTs want the best of both worlds and this is accomplished by giving ontological theory priority over epistemological problems.  Is this what new materials, specifically Bryant, are guilty of? Solving alleged problems of epistemology by privileging ontology?    Each of the CSTs that Pleasants discusses claim to be anti-essentialists. Pleasants argues that essentialism only applies to Cartesian and Kantian attempts to show undisputable 'epistemic foundations'.  'Critical social theorists' interpretation of fallibilism therefore has the consequence of re-admitting a very close relation of foundationalism via the back door, as it were. Ontological realism is, in my view, simply an updated post-Cartesian/Kantian version of traditional foundationalism - it is an 'ontological foundationalism'.  Why is essentialism bad, specifically in TC and PM?     p.25   Immanent critique  - demonstrates that a position is inadequate because of internal contradictions and absurdities.  position isn't wrong because it conflicts with one's own view of \"how things really are\" but rather because of problematic because of the \" proponent's  standards and criteria for knowledge.\"  see W's private language argument.      The private language argument is, in fact, an argument 'against Cartesian and empiricist notions of epistemic privacy'.  But  it should not be taken as W's concept of a 'correct' vieew of mental experience.       Keith p.28 - In case anyone (Scott) wants to argue that frameworks and foundations are what enables us to proceed, so to speak, there is Keith's contention via W that \"once a theory has become a lens through we can see only part of the important evidence and examples, even armchair philosophizing goes astray.\"   p.29  What is the problem with normative theories? (W rejects or displaces the normative component of linguistic and communication theory).",

As Schatzki writes:   \"...actors draw on structures, thereby participating in practices and reinterating their own organizing structures. Hence, the structures of practices also govern practices' constituent actions.\"   291 \n* Giddens understanding of structure:\n    1. Rules\n    2. Resources - the medium through which social power is enacted. Giddens notes that social power is understood here as the capacity to bring about change in a situation where doing so is subject to the actions of others. This seems (to me at least) to be Giddens account of agency.  In this way, we can say more directly that use of a resource is the act of securing the actions of other required to bring about an outcome.   So structure both organizes and governs actions (that make up practices)  is itself made up of  sets of rules .  rules  are codes and norms, which are \"methodologically applied\" and \"generalizable procedures of action\" that arise from the practical activities of daily life (we could paraphrase to say that rules are norms that arise from \"going about\" one's daily activities). It is through repeated observance of these rules (largely determined by dispositions inculcated by cultural upbringing, societal/cultural pressure or judgment, and the act(s) repeated observance themselves) that these rules are codified, so to speak, although it seems neither Giddens nor Wittgenstein construe the process by which rules are developed and perpetuated that concretely.

Resources  \"Through the use of or reliance on resources, actors bring others to perform actions through which specific outcomes are secured.\"     292 - Bourdieu v. Giddens   For Bourdieu, habitus alone is what determines action.  Giddens maintains that actions can also be determined by reasons (the unspoken grounds for actions) and desires (deep, perhaps subconscous motivations).  292-93    Summary of Bourdieu's system of oppostions :\n    1. organize practices by structuring arrays of actions - what is done, when, and where.\n    2. determine actions by structuring the selection of (sensible) actions  For Bourdieu, the identity of an action stems from oppositions that organize practices.   Summary of Giddens: \n    * Rules and resources:\n        1. govern practices by defining fields of possible actions.\n        2. determine what actions are possible via a practical consciousness that situates/orients activity  For Giddens, an actions receive at least part of its identity from the organization of the practice of which it is a part.",

It is divided into two parts. The first lists expressions arising from the logic of the conduit metaphor; the second lists expressions which are either metaphorically neutral or involve logics alternative to the conduit metaphor. Further search for expressions, along with a more elaborate means of analyzing and classifying, will be required before either collection can be termed complete. In some cases, in Part One, core expressions which I have placed in one category could with justification be placed in a different category as well. These and other niceties must await later exposition. One or two examples follow each expression.  Click below to see these lists.\n\n\nPart One: The conduit metaphor\n\n\nI.

It is divided into two parts. The first lists expressions arising from the logic of the conduit metaphor; the second lists expressions which are either metaphorically neutral or involve logics alternative to the conduit metaphor. Further search for expressions, along with a more elaborate means of analyzing and classifying, will be required before either collection can be termed complete. In some cases, in Part One, core expressions which I have placed in one category could with justification be placed in a different category as well.

RM be hidden (away) in S  \u201cThe  attitudes  I want to show you  are hidden  away someplace in the last  chapter .\u201d    This example is particularly interesting: the phrase 'I want to show you' combined with 'hidden away' implies the RM ( attitudes ) we intentionally obscured  within  the (s)/vessel (IOW, the  chapter ).    73.  RM be/get lost in S  \u201cMary has good  ideas , but  they   get lost in  her run-on  sentences .\u201d    Again, interesting because this all but directly implies that  ideas  can be lost or concealed  within  signals (s) ( sentences , in this case)    74.  RM be buried in S  \u201cYes, but the man\u2019s  thought   is buried in  these terribly dense and difficult  paragraphs .\u201d    Again, RM can be obscured  in  signals/(s)/words - i.e. ideas, thoughts, can be placed inside words for multiple purposes; frequently this purpose is obfuscation.    75.  RM be sunk in S  \u201cThe  thought  is  there , although I grant that it\u2019s  sunk pretty deep in  paradoxical  language .\u201d    'there' refers to the (s) - the language that the RM is \"sunk\" in.    76.  lay bare RM in S  \u201cJohn\u2019s  analysis  really  lays bare  the  ideas  in the  chapter .\u201d    ' analysis ' and ' chapter ' both indicate (s)'s - the vessels in which mental components are contained and transmitted.    77.  bare RM in S  \u201cYou  have bared  the hidden  meanings  in the  sentence .\u201d       78.  unseal RM in S  \u201cTo  unseal  the  meaning  in Wittgenstein\u2019s curious  phrases  is no easy task.\u201d       79.  expose RM in S  \u201cYou have  exposed  certain  feelings  in the  essay  of which the author would not be proud.\u201d",

Alternatives to Categories IC and IF of the Conduit Metaphor: Expressions which do not imply that words contain or convey meanings, or that ideas exist independent of human beings in an abstract \u201cspace.\u201d \n33.

S mean/have meanings (to someone)\n\u201cI hope my words mean something to you.\u201d\n(It appears that we make up for the poverty of this category by reusing many Category I expressions with S words, as opposed to humans, as subjects. Thus, \u201cJohn\u2019s words tell us of his ideas,\u201d or \u201cThis sentence states your thoughts plainly.\u201d Whether this personification of the signals is linked to the conduit metaphor or not, I have not yet determined. The conduit metaphor does view words as containing ideas just as humans do, however, which could provide motivation for the transfer. That is, the signals could be \u201cgiving us the ideas they contain,\u201d just as, in speaking, humans \u201cgive us the ideas they contain.\u201d This question will have to await deeper analysis.)
