<ul>
<li><strong>p.4 (4318)</strong></li>
<li>PMBOK offers very little advice about communication - only really suggests breaking communication into "manageable, predictable, and orderly" steps (and more to the point, linear steps). <strong>Human communication is decidedly not linear.</strong></li>
<li>Implies that, if followed precisely, the planning and action steps prescribed by PMBOK will "naturally" result in good communication practices.</li>
<li>What does 'actuality' mean?</li>
<li>Schramm [36] - Shannon-Weaver model doesn't account for the role of social-contexts and "shared field of experience" in human communication<ul>
<li>cross-reference with "use existing social structures" from "experimental modes"??</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>furthermore, S-W model doesn't account for meaning-making (Bowman and Targowski [3]) nor does it consider the impacts of sender/receiver worldviews, experience, or how the act of interpretation shapes meaning.</p>
<ul>
<li>cross-reference with Wittgenstein/Schatzki - practical understanding, rule-interpretation, which are shaped by upbringing and experience, shape meaning and practices.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>p.5 (4319)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>Bottom line is that, even if S-W and PMBOK offer some helpful suggestions for successful communication, the underlying assumptions don't provide adequate basis for developing the types of communication processes that are needed for successful IT PM.<ul>
<li>What is required for successful comm in IT PM situations??</li>
<li>Success = delivery of product AND business value</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>S-W, conduit, or transmission model focuses on information flows, doesn't take into account context, content, intention, interpretation, meaning [17].</li>
<li><em><strong>4.2 - Galle's model</strong></em> [12]</li>
<li>In order for IT projects to be successful, communication processes must include both production and interpretation of ideas amongst stakeholders, and are supported by artefacts [sic]<ul>
<li>what do they mean by artefact? <em>see page 6 - artefact = product</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>see red highlighting + comment: This is problematic - seems to invoke picture theory of language, which Wittgenstein ultimately showed to be an incomplete understanding - must an idea, concept, or whatever begin as a mental construct??</li>
<li>
<p>the solution suggested by Galle is that there is an interactive and iterative communication process through which various parties arrive at shared meaning - construe as a set of practices involving discourse through which meaning is derived - ex. group design in lean UX??</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>p.6 (4320)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>"The final project outcomes, both an IT artefact [sic] (product) and the delivery of value for key stakeholders, will only occur successfully if there are no substantial breakdowns in the sequence of productive and interpretive iterative, social interactions that occur amongst key players in the IT project context."</li>
<li>Bottom line for Galle is that communication is a social process...Duh?</li>
<li>"the glue between productive and interpretive activities, for Galle, is communication both verbal and non-verbal, which is mediated by artefacts produced along the way."</li>
<li>However, Galle doesn't really provide insight into the "contextual nature of meaning and understanding."</li>
<li>In other words, Galle doesn't directly account for the role of the different social and cultural backgrounds that individuals bring to an IT project situation, which shapes interpretation and understanding. The social, cultural, historical backgrounds shape how individuals and groups generate and maintain practices, and these can clash with the practices of those from different backgrounds.<ul>
<li>social, cultural, etc. background doesn't only refer to what we typically think of as upbringing - i.e. what is culturally inclulcated from birth - but also includes post-childhood, post-primary training and education (which are of course also shaped by social and cultural context). This education and training is especially relevant in IT project situations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The gaps in communication that can result from failure to take this into account are addressed by Wittgenstein's concept of language games.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><strong>4.2 - Language games</strong></em> [44]</p>
<ul>
<li>"Communication is composed of a multiplicity of language games in which meanings are constructed and understood by actors in specific contexts."</li>
<li>"...the meanings of words are not simply denoted by the things they refer to...reference not establish meaning but [instead] relies on meaning and understanding."</li>
<li>language and communication are not just concerned with words and meanings, they necesarily also include the individuals and groups whose experiences, backgrounds, and interactions shape words and meanings. Meaning is always context dependant, which explains how different groups within the same organization can develop communication practices that differ from other groups in the same organization. (they differ but can also be related, similar, mutually intelligeable, etc. via family resemblance).</li>
<li>Language games are subject to rules that have been "learned in context" i.e. culturally, socially instilled.<ul>
<li>this is actually crucial for communication to work at all - communicating parties from different backgrounds nonetheless must have some shared understandings if they are to successfully communicate</li>
<li>parties from from different backgrounds utilize these commonalities to realign their specific context-dependant communication practices in order to facilitate communication.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>"Communication exchanges are goal-directed, purposeful and generally intentional"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>p.8 (4322)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>look up Vann [41] - regarding problem of IT project failure in public sector<ul>
<li>in this situation, myriad cultural, social, and linguistic "clashes" are possible as many different groups may have to interact: career public servants and other bureaucrats used to a particular way of operating, IT professionals/other technical types, government employees...really anyone can become entrenched and "stuck" in a particular language game.</li>
<li>It is the job of the PM to bridge these divides - and TCs are uniquely situated because they must often move in and out of multiple contexts, and may have technical skills/knowledge but also the ability to sympathize and thus teach and communicate with less technically skilled individuals.</li>
</ul>
</li>
