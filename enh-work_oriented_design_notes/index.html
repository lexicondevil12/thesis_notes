<p><strong>- Prologue </strong>
 - pp.6
     - Involving users in the design process serves two functions:
         - emphasizes qualification and participation which suppports  a democratic approach to design.
         - "Skill and participation in design as a <strong>creative and communicative</strong> process."
     - "<em>critique of the political rationality</em> of the design process points to a <em>critique of the scientific rationality</em> of methods for systems description"
         - What is a "systems description?"
         - What is "systems thinking?"
     - still, Ehn does not abandon systems thinking entirely and still views it as an important tool.
     - Instead suggests that we re-think design methods and move beyond Cartesian/representational modes of thinking and transmission understandings of communication.
         - ultimate goal is to enable an approach to design that encourages collaboration between designers (adapting to my situation, technologists and PMs) and users (community members) by involving community members in the development process - i.e. building <em>with</em> rather than <em>for</em>.
 - pp. 29
     - "The Wittgensteinian approach gives an 'untheoretical' way of understanding the practice of design and use of computer artifacts. Knowledge is understood...with emphasis on competence as having learned to follow rules in practice. The suggestion is to think of <em>design and use activities as language-games</em> that people play in ordinary use of language."</p>
<p><strong>- Part I intro</strong>
- pp.41
    - Argues that there is more knowledge to be found in the practice [of design] and use than could ever be formally captured in a systems description.
- pp.45:
    - "The aspects of things that are most important to us are hidden because of their simplicity and familiarity. (One
is unable to notice something - because it is always
before one's eyes.) The real foundations of his enquiry
do not strike man at all. Unless that fact has at some
time struck him. - And this means: we fail to be struck
by what, once seen, is most striking and most powerful."
 - Wittgenstein, L.: <em>Philosophical Investigations</em>, Basil Blackwell,
Oxford (1953) 1963, ยง 129.</p>
<p><strong>- Chapter 1: Cartesian Approach</strong>
 - pp.47
     - Relation between model and reality: "a model is a map or mirror-image of some part of reality. It is based on observations in the object field..."
     - we make propositions about the properties of a model (theorems), model + theorems = theory.
     - This constitutes a view of reality.
 - pp.48 - 49
     - a system description (in computer or info science) posits that a <em>system</em> is a "part of the world that we regard as a whole."
     - a system exists in the real world and has specific relations, which we describe in a systems description - and a systems description is what we get when we "transmit" information about a system (that either exists in our own mind or external to our own mind - either way, the language of the description resides in the human mind) to the mind of another person. The other person then creates a mental model of the described system in their own mind.
 - pp. 51
     - All three of Ehn's examples of systems thinking can be classified as "Cartesian" in that "they share the philosophical assumptions of <em>rationalistic reasoning as epistemology</em>, and that <em>dualism as ontology</em> is taken for granted."
 - pp.52
     - protoypical Cartesian subject is the observer, who does not participate in the world he/she studies.
     - The bottom line is that the Cartesian view posits an inner/mental world of experiences and an outer world of objects. With language, which resides in the inner mental/experiential realm of the observer, the observer can describe the outer world of objects and it is assumed that the inner/mental realm "reflects" the outer realm of objects.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>pp.53-54</p>
<ul>
<li>see bullet points re: ontological dualism:<ul>
<li>We inhabit the "real world" which is made of objects that possess properties.</li>
<li>There are "objective" facts about the external world of objects that exist independently of interpretation and observation by humans.</li>
<li>The acts of perception and interpretation by the mind (the internal/mental realm) generate facts about the world, which can be innaccurate, but nevertheless are assumed to reflect reality.</li>
<li>The subsequent thoughts and intentions reflected in our actions result in bodily motion - i.e. it posits a causal relationship.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>notably, this is considered a rational, rather than creative and social exercise.</li>
<li>"Cartesian mind-body dualism paradoxically suggests that there is a 'ghost in the machine.'". - Ryle, <em>The Concept of the Mind</em></li>
<li><em>Cartesian view makes practical skills and subjectivity invisible - the social construction of reality is hidden.</em><ul>
<li>Cartesian view = "what we know about the world is a reflection or mirror image of the outer world of objects."</li>
<li>What if instead we assume that the outer world is socially constructed?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>pp.55</p>
<ul>
<li>Wittgenstein: "What I see in the dawning of an aspect is not an attribute of the object, but an internal relation between it and other objects." - Wittgenstein, <em>Philosophical Investigations</em>, Basil Blackwell, Oxford (1953) 1963, p.212</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If we assume social construction, then we don't have to make assumptions about individual mental representations of "external Cartesian world independent of language."<ul>
<li>What is the difference between 'aspects' and 'attributes?'</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>"Aspects of objects, as opposed to attributes, become, as Ragnar Rommetveit has argued, theoretically anchored in the constructivist assumption"</li>
<li>
<p>"The 'dawning of an aspect' takes place as situated cognition and communication by which we actively make sense of the world and 'bring it to language.' There is a shift from language as description to language as action. And furthermore, for the sense I make of the world to be accepted by others as intersubjectively valid, it must to some extent be a matter of social control and negotiation."</p>

<li>"...cartesian view...similar to rationalistic view of a professional designer who makes detailed plans of all future steps in advance"</li>
